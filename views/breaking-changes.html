		<p>Breaking changes since v6.x</p>

			<li>
				All attributes have been changed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Document hacks are not required anymore.

				Item label and button label syntax changed.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Breaking changes since v5.2.x</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				CSS class names were changed/improved. If your code relied on class matching, please review it.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Breaking changes since v5.1.x</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>item-label</code> now uses normal curly braces <code ng-non-bindable>{{ foo }}</code> instead of the previous <code>{| foo |}</code> from 5.0.x.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Breaking changes since v5.x.x</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>input-model</code> can now be an array with nested arrays inside.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>ouput-model</code> is not required anymore if you don't need it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>group-property</code> syntax has changed.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>item-label</code> syntax has changed.

			<li>
				<code>button-label</code> is not used anymore.
			</li>
			<p>
			Please note that v5.x.x is the result of a fork of the project and the entire code  was rewritten.
			It is possible that your code doesn't work with v5.x.x without some changes, so please test everything
			before putting this in production. Also, feel free to report any bugs.
			</p>
		</ul>

		<p>Breaking changes since v3.x.x</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>input-model</code> <strike>is now static (not dynamically updated), hence why we need output-model. On the plus side, you now can
				re-use the input model where necessary.</strike> Sorry, it's now back like version 2.x.x. As for now it's the only way to allow dynamic
				update into the input-model. If you need to re-use the input model, copy them into a new variable.
			</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Breaking changes since v2.x.x</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				File name and the directive name have been changed. I am really sorry for this, but this is the only workaround
				to prevent wrong language statistic in Github (they don't count files whose name starts with "angular"). The repository name stays the same.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>output-model</code> is now required.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>input-model</code> is now static (not dynamically updated), hence why we need output-model. On the plus side, you now can
				re-use the input model where necessary.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>default-label</code> is deprecated. Custom text and translations can be done using the <code>translation</code> attribute.
			</li>
		</ul>
